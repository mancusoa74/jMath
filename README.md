# jMath v0.4
Simple Kivy (https://kivy.org/) Game for first grader Kids

This is my first project in Kivy and hence quite simple.

it can be freeley downloaded for free here:://goo.gl/MB9Jmk 

It is based on a real needs, help my daugther to learn first grade math.

The game is trivial and it is asking the player to solve some simple operation.

Once the player answers correctly 10 operations, she access to the next level.

The are 4 level for the foour main operations. Once completed level 4 it starts again but with more difficulty (higher speed of the baloons)
